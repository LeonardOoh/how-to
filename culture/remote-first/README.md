Remote first
=========

We are a remote-first team. A “remote first” mindset means assuming that all of your coworkers are remote for the purposes of communication and collaboration. This means we:

- **Proactively communicate.** Because we’re remote, it’s pretty easy to feel isolated or lose track of who’s working on what. Moreover, without actively sharing what you’re working on it can become easy for others to get the (inaccurate) impression that you’re not working on anything. To stave off those tendencies, we proactively update our colleagues on our progress at least once per day.

- **Use our words.** It sounds obvious when you say it, but it’s incredibly important to describe---with words---what you’re talking about when working remotely. In an office, your colleagues may be able to see your draft or design mockup on your screen. When you’re working remotely, it’s better to assume they can’t and over-explain to avoid confusion or misunderstanding.

- **Assume people are working asynchronously.** As of April, 2016, we have team members and clients in eight time zones. It’s rare that they’re all online and working at the same time, so we operate on the assumption that responses will be delayed---not immediate. To facilitate this, we use tools and communications platforms in which everything is documented, searchable, and traceable to a permalink. People will follow up when they can, and nothing gets lost in the meantime.

- **Are patient.** Unless a decision needs to be made immediately, we give people time to respond to queries because they might be working on a different schedule or in a different time zone.

- **Keep records.** As noted above, we do our best to ensure that every discussion, draft, and decision is searchable and has a permalink for future reference. This is especially important for conversations that happen aloud (audio/video/in-person). We operate on the assumption that not everyone heard or will remember what we discussed/decided and record & publish notes accordingly.

- **Avoid email.** Email is terrible. It’s quickly fragmented, not well threaded, and offers no canonical permalink for shared reference. We essentially never use it internally, and avoid it with clients to the extent possible. Discussions & decisions made via email should be treated like they were said aloud (see above).

- **Try to have face-to-face conversations at least once per week.** There’s a lot of great collaboration that can be done on the web today, but there’s no substitute for seeing someone’s face and hearing someone’s voice. Google Hangouts is our go-to on this front.

- **Leverage cloud storage for our documents.** We use GitHub and Google Drive to make sure everyone has access to the files & documents that they need, and those documents are transparently shared with the rest of the team. Work files should never be locked in someone’s local machine.
