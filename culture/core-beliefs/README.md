# What we believe

Below are a few of the core convictions that drive our decision making.

- We believe that politics ought to be a battle of ideas, not a battle of technology.
- We believe that winning campaigns invest early in digital & field, and that organizing works.
- We believe that effective digital strategy---and effective web design---is often more about execution than innovation. Like great baseball teams, winning digital teams are those who consistently execute on the fundamentals: engaging web design, steady organic email list growth, and effective online fundraising.
- We believe in creating the digital content we’d want to consume, rather than churning out garbage for short-term returns..
- We believe that good ideas and all-star contributions come from the most unlikely of places, which is why we are first and foremost a remote company.
- We believe in using the best software available. Period. We’re a consultancy---not a software company---and our clients expect and deserve that we’ll use the best tools to help them succeed.
