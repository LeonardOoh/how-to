Obviously.

## What goes here

- *How-to guides & company resources.* GitHub makes it easy to build and iterate upon company-wide resources over time. Anyone can [contribute](../../CONTRIBUTING.md), but ultimately changed have to be approved and merged to master to become “official.”

- *Website theme development*, obviously. More to come on how to best handle version control with NationBuilder themes (it’s not easy), but all of our code ought to be tracked.

- *Graphic design files.* If we’re going to be doing a lot of versioning of images, it makes sense to store them in a git repository so we can [track versioning][github-for-images].
