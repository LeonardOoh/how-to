Slack is the heartbeat of Hines Digital---our primary chat app and notification center.

## Channels

Slack allows us to create channels to talk to everyone at once. Think chat rooms, but better.

### Naming channels

Slack channels for client projects ought to be named to match the relevant project’s [Google Drive folder name][googledrive]. For example, Justin Ready’s website design channel would be #2016-justinready-redesign.

There should be one channel per project, not one channel per client. Keep things clearly separated.

### General & Random

By default slack has two channels, General and Random, and all users are added. General is a place to talk about non work related stuff and Random is a scary place of pure randomness.

### ext-

Some channels begin with and ext-, these channels allow clients to join in on the conversation.

## Direct Messages

Not all conversations have to be public. If you need to say something in private you can send a direct message (DM), think Instant Messenger. DMs can include more than two people.

## Notifications

Get notified when someone mentions you in conversation, sends you a direct message or setup a list of keywords to be notified when someone mentions something important, like ping pong.

### Twitter

Slack really likes to keep everyone in the loop so it shares Twitter notifications. When someone mentions [@HinesDigital](https://twitter.com/HinesDigital) on Twitter it shows up in the General channel for all Sparkboxers to see.

## The Apps

Slack is better when you use it through the apps:

- [Android][apps]
