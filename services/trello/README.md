# Trello

[![Trello's Logo][producti]][product]

Our preferred project / task management software.

## How we use it

We use Trello to try units of work through a process, which generally looks like:

- Ideas
- To-Do
- Doing
- For-Review
- Approved
- Done

Sometimes, we use Trello boards for unconvention purposes, like to document new hire onboarding, members of various teams, etc.

### One board per “project”

For the purpose of Trello boards, we’re defining a “project” differently than we are for [Google Drive folders][googledrive].

If we’re performing multiple roles for a given client _(i.e., HD Express, web design, full service digital, etc.)_, we should create multiple boards to track each aspect of the project. Each component part of our work with a client may have different team members involved, different workflows, etc., and it’s worth keeping them separated to a reasonable extent.

### Naming Boards

Like [Google Drive folders][googledrive], Trello boards should be named #year-slug-purpose. For example, Justin Ready’s website design board would be #2016-justinready-webdesign. If we’re splitting a single contract into multiple boards (as described above), just hyphen the board name one layer further _(ex: #2016-amash-fullservice-website)_.

Consistently naming things helps keep it clear where to look across platforms & tools.

### Card etiquette

When using Trello cards, always over-communicate. In particular, these are good tips:

- *Use the [Power-Ups][powerups].* They really help to connect Trello smartly to other services we use, and make the cards come alive. Metaphorically. Not really---that’d be crazy.
- *Add yourself as a member* to cards you’re working on. Having your photo on the card communicates to everyone else on the team that you’re accountable for that work. It’s crucial.
- *Comment on the card.* If you’re going to discuss the work that’s tracked on a Trello card, it’s good to do it there (rather than generally in the Slack channel). Centralizing the conversation there helps make your comments easier to find, later.
- *Add attachments.* Remember, this Trello card is the hub for that work. No matter if the file is stored in Google Drive, etc., it’s good to add it as an attachment to the card so it’s easy to find later.
