# Digital & Field Blog Composition & Tips

Tips & directives for writing for [Digital & Field][link].

## How to draft articles

For every article on [Digital & Field][link] there should be a card on [this board][trello].

On that card, you should:

- Use card name to summarize the topic / title of the article
- Use the description to summarize the article (not more than 5 sentences)
- Add the URL of your Medium draft as an “attachment” on the card.
- Apply labels to the card that correspond to tags on the blog
- Add yourself as a “member” on the card if you’re working on the article.

Articles themselves should be drafted directly on Medium. That way as people edit / provide feedback on your draft those changes are automatically reflected on Medium (and credit is given to contributors in the footnotes). _If you draft articles offline or in another app, load them into a draft on Medium before moving them to the “editing” list on the [board][trello]._

## General Tips
