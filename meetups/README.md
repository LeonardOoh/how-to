# Meetups

How to run a meetup at Hines Digital.

## Website/Calendar

 - Venue Availability - Check with WeWork DC about whether they have venue availability on the dates we want. Confirm before announcing the event.
 - Know/distribute Topic at least 3 weeks in advance (to have it before prior meetup would be ideal, so we can also announce at that)
 - Line up event speakers / panel.
 - Backup topic
 - Create an event on Facebook
 - Include the topics list

## Buildup

**3 weeks before**
 - Email [Speaker Prep][speaker_prep]
 - Buffer tweets for next meetup (3wk topic, 2wk RSVP, 1wk RSVP, day of turnout reminder)

**1 week before**
 - Confirm with WeWork that they remember weâ€™re coming
