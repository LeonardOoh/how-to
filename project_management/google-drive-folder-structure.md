# Google Drive Folder Structure

## Client Folders

For each client organization, there is a folder in Google Drive’s “Clients” folder. This folder should have the official legal name of the client’s organization _(i.e., "Friends of Justin Ready")_.

## Project Folders

Within each client folder there ought to be a single folder for each specific project.

For this purpose, we’ll define multiple roles under a single contract as a single “project” _(i.e., if we’re hired to build a website and run full-service digital strategy, that’s one project)_. If we’re re-hired in a subsequent election cycle, for example, or in another role during the same cycle (with a new contract), that’d be a new project.

This folder should be named {{ year }}-{{ client nation slug }}-{{ project descriptor }} _(ex: 2016-justinready-fullservice)_.

###Possible Project Descriptors

There are essentially three “project categories” we can use in naming: “hdexpress”, “webdesign”, and “fullservice”. These correlate with the three categories of services we offer our clients:

- *hdexpress*: For projects where we’ve been hired for our [HD Express][hdexpress] service.
- *webdesign*: For projects where we’ve been hired just to build and support custom website design.
- *fullservice*: For projects where we’ve been hired to handle a client’s digital strategy, top to bottom.

### Sub-folders

Within each project folder, there ought to be at least four folders.

- *Planning.* All the early-stage discovery & planning materials.
- *Copywriting.* Email drafts, website copy, etc., separated into subfolders accordingly. And within each sub-category _(ex: email drafts)_ there should be `draft` and `approved` folders. Once copy has been approved, move it to the `approved` folder.
- *Design.* Mockups, design drafts, etc. _Not code._
- *From Client.* This is a repository of all the materials the client has sent us. This will tend to have a number of sub-folders.
- *Legal.* Contracts, project proposals, invoices, etc.
- *Shareable.* Documents, graphics, etc., that have been approved for public consumption.
