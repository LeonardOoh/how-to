# Google Drive Folder Structure

## Client Folders

For each client organization, there is a folder in Google Drive’s “Clients” folder. This folder should have the official legal name of the client’s organization _(i.e., "Friends of Justin Ready")_.

## Project Folders

Within each client folder there ought to be a single folder for each specific project.

This folder should be named {{ year }}-{{ client nation slug }}-{{ project descriptor }} _(ex: 2016-justinready-redesign)_.

### Sub-folders

Within each project folder, there ought to be at least four folders.

- *Planning.* All the early-stage discovery & planning materials.
- *Copywriting.* Email drafts, website copy, etc., separated into subfolders accordingly. And within each sub-category _(ex: email drafts)_ there should be `draft` and `approved` folders. Once copy has been approved, move it to the `approved` folder.
- *Design.* Mockups, design drafts, etc. _Not code._
- *From `client`.* This is a repository of all the materials the client has sent us. This will tend to have a number of sub-folders.
- *Legal.* Contracts, project proposals, invoices, etc.
- *Shareable.* Documents, graphics, etc., that have been approved for public consumption.
