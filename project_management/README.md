# Project Management

While there are a few constants _(Google Drive, Slack, Trello, etc.)_, we try to be flexible with our toolset and approach to ensure we’re serving each client responsibly.

To help counter the confusion that comes with using numerous tools and repositories for large projects, we find it's helpful to create a Project Hub.

## Project Hubs

For every project we take on, we create a card on our [Projects][projects-board].

This card serves as a central hub for keeping organized. On it, we track:

- *Members.* Add everyone who’s working on the project.
- *Services.* Attach a link to each service _(i.e., Google Drive folder, Trello board, Slack channel)_ used on the project.
- *Legal.* Attach (via Google Drive) the project’s signed contract and written proposal.
- *Description.* In the card’s “description,” we track team roles, project objectives, etc.

## People

Richie & Leonard are our main project managers. They plan things, keep us on task, budget time, and so much more.

Ian is our lead on sales, quoting project scopes, etc.
